The webapp have a constant xor vulnerability, the cookie is a dictionary representation of the user xored with a predefined key. The key should be long enough but it is suseptible to known plaintext attack. Find the position in the string that represents the 1 for the admin key and xor it to find the key, and replace with 0.

In this case, decrement the second to last byte of the cookie by 1 and you should get the flag.


Sample cookie format:

"{"username": "asd", "displays": "asd", "uid": 1}"
