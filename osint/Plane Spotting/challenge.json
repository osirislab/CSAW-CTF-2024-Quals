Can you find the squawk number of this Russian plane, the airport code of where the plane was finally parked at, as well as the registration number of the plane owned by the celebrity? Oh, also find the city the Russian plane was closest to at 21:07:40 Z during its flights in the US! Flag format: csawctf{SquawkNumber_AirportCode_RegistrationNumber_CityName}",
