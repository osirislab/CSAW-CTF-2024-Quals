## Description

This challenge is intended to test participants' use of open-source intelligence tools and searching tools. The intended difficulty is hard.

My friend swears he saw a Russian plane in the US this June, but I don't believe him. He also says he saw it was parked next to a plane owned by an infamous former president! Can you find the squawk number of this Russian plane, the airport code of where the plane was finally parked at, as well as the registration number of the plane owned by the celebrity? Oh, also find the city the Russian plane was closest to at 21:07:40 Z during its flights in the US! Flag format: csawctf{SquawkNumber_AirportCode_RegistrationNumber_CityName}

You can find this plane, and use ADB or other flight tracking software to find all the details about the plane and when it was there. Searching around some more, you can find that it was parked next to the plane of an infamous celebrity, and find the details for that as well.
