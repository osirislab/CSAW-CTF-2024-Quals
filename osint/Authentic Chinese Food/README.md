## Description

This challenge is intended to test participants' search skills with public records as well as geolocation. The intended difficulty is easy.

I visited this gourmet restaurant a while back, but I'm worried about the  health and safety rating of it. Could you check it for me? Oh, and before I forget, could you tell me when the building was built, as well as the name of the LLC that owns it? Flag Format: csawctf{HealthGrade_YearBuilt_LLCName} (Name does not include LLC, replace all spaces with _)

   This Panda Express is actually one near the lab, and can be reverse image searched on a stock image website. You can then look at NYC's official building records to find the rest of the information.
