## Description

This challenge is intended to test participants' search skills. The intended difficulty is medium.

(Must complete Literally 1984 to unlock) Remember the composer from Literally 1984? Well, they made a song when they were part of a band in 1992, and it turns out that â€Œ also made a cover of this song, collabing with another artist. What is the name of that artist? Flag Format: csawctf{ArtistName} (replace all spaces with _)

   Searching easily gets us the artist's old band, and all the songs they released that year. Looking for x0o0x being connected to any one, we find their collab on Lab=01 with Chogakusei.
